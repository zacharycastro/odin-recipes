            In a shallow bowl combine flour, egg, parsley, garlic powder, oregano, 
            salt and pepper. Gradually add beer, stirring, until a thick batter forms. 
            Add more or less beer depending on the desired consistency of the batter.

        <li>
            In a heavy frying pan heat oil 
            (adjust amount, depending on the size of your pan, so that you have a couple of inches of oil) over medium-high heat. 
            When oil is hot, dip onions in batter and fry, turning once to brown evenly on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
